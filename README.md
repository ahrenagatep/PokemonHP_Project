A Java-based application that simulates Pokémon battles from the game Pokémon. It allows users to choose between four Pokémon (Charizard, Snorlax, Wooper, Eevee) each with different stats of health, defense, attack, and special attack.

# Features:
* Choose among four different Pokémon   
* Engage in turn-based battles between Pokémon   
* Use potions to heal Pokémon during battle   
* Execute risky attacks for a chance of higher damage output   
* Perform bulk-up moves to increase attack and defense stats   

# How to play:
2 players are required, each player picks a Pokémon.  
After both players have picked their Pokémon, they will take turns choosing between four different actions to perform.
